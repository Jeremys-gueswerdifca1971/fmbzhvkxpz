Oh man, just stepped out of Havoc, and my head’s still spinning like a dental drill on high speed. The whole theater was buzzing like it was alive, popcorn all over — think I’ve got some stuck in my shoe, eugh. I cant believe how intense it was... the movie, not the popcorn. Like, imagine if a crown suddenly became sentient and started hosting a party in your mouth. That's how jumbled my mind feels right now.

> The plot, jeez, where do I even start? It’s like trying to explain to a patient the importance of flossing, and they just stare back with that look that says “wait, do you need a license for that?”. Chaotic scenes, everything just crashing and smashing. There's this one part where the main guy, he kinda reminds me of a rogue toothbrush that just doesn’t know when to quit — scrubbing through layer after layer of grime.

I swear the whole final scene was like getting a wisdom tooth extracted while a band played in the waiting room. Loud, kinda painful, but at the end, you feel... relief? Or maybe winded, not sure. And I could swear one fight scene made me feel like from nowhere, I suddenly got hit with the sound of a thousand electric toothbrushes buzzing in unison. No wonder my back hurts from sitting all tense.

Some guy behind me kept downloading the tension with each slurp of his drink, I'm sure. @Billy asked me how to download the movie, but honestly, I’d say just watch the movie — those visuals transform in the big screen chaos. It's hard to explain but trust me, a home screen doesn’t cut it. Or maybe it will. Can't recall how that saying goes.

Those punches were like molar taps, testing for toothache but in 10x speed. Blink and you’re knee-deep in some mad storyline pacing like a patient with caffeine overdose during a 7am appointment. My phone's at 3%, prob long enough to waste it typing this out. Anyway, it’s like every plot twist was a cavity you didn’t see coming — bam, another one! Almost wish I could just prescibe them a fluoride rinse and say aaaaand relax.

public void NonSenseCode()
{
    int randomThoughts = 0;
    while(chaos){ 
        system.out.println(More Havoc);
        if(randomThoughts > popcornScraps)
            break;
        randomThoughts++;
    }
    return abstraction();
}
```
